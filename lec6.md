### Coontrolled Data Redundancy

Characteristics

- Deliberate duplication of data.

- Implemented to improve performance, reliability, or availability

- Usually documented and managed by the database design.

Purposes

Faster access:

- Store frequently accessed data in multiple locations to reduce query time.

Backup and recovery:

- Redundant copies allow restoration after failure.

Distributed systems:

- Replicating data across servers improves availability and fault tolerance.

Indexing and denormalization:

- Storing redundant values can reduce complex joins in analytical queries.

Benefits

- Improves query performance.

- Increases fault tolerance.

- Ensures high availability in distributed DBs.

- Can simplify reporting.

Costs

- Increases storage needs.

- Requires synchronization mechanisms.

- Adds complexity to update processes.


##### Comparing Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Redundancy

- Uncontrolled Redundancy

- Accidental.

- Leads to inconsistency and anomalies.

- Symptom of poor database design.

- Solved by normalization and enforcing constraints.

- Controlled Redundancy

- Intentional and strategic.

- Improves speed, reliability, and availability.

- Managed by replication tools, triggers, or denormalization.

- Accepted trade-off between space and performance.
